# StormyWeather
Simple weather app built with Swift

This is a single page weather application built using Swift 2.0 following the Treehouse Tutorial "How to build a weather app". 
StormyWeather connects with the forecast api to retrieve weather data from Alcatraz Island. 
Keys are not provided, so app will not function via github.
Next steps will be to create an input field for users to search specific locations weather info.
